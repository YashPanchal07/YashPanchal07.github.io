            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education in India is primarily provided by public schools (controlled
                and funded by the government at three levels: central, state and local) and private schools. Under
                various articles of the Indian Constitution, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental
                right to children aged 6 to 14. The approximate ratio of public schools to private schools in India is
                7:5. Major policy initiatives in Indian education are numerous. Up until 1976, education policies and
                implementation were determined legally by each of India’s constitutional states. The 42nd amendment to
                the constitution in 1976 made education a ‘concurrent subject’. From this point on the central and state
                governments shared formal responsibility for funding and administration of education.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education policy is prepared by the Central Government and State
                Governments at national and state levels respectively. The National Policy on Education (NPE), 1986, has
                provided for environment awareness, science and technology education, and introduction of traditional
                elements such as Yoga into the Indian secondary school system. A significant feature of India's
                secondary school system is the emphasis on inclusion of the disadvantaged sections of the
                society.Professionals from established institutes are often called to support in vocational training.
                Another feature of India's secondary school system is its emphasis on profession based vocational
                training to help students attain skills for finding a vocation of his/her choosing.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Increased competition to get admission in reputed colleges has given
                rise to private coaching institutes in India. They prepare students for engineering, medical, MBA, SAT,
                GRE, banking jobs' entrance tests. There are also coaching institutes that teach subjects like English
                for employment in India and abroad.Private coaching institutes are of two types: offline coaching and
                online coaching. There are many online coaching centres and apps available in the market and their usage
                is growing, especially in tier 2 metro cities.A 2013 survey by ASSOCHAM predicted the size of private
                coaching industry to grow to $40 billion, or Rs 2.39 trillion (short scale) by 2015.
